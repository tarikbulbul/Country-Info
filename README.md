This website displays country information using the REST Countries API and provides the ability to show the country's location on Google Maps. It features a search bar where you can enter a country name to display its flag and name. Clicking on a country will take you to a details page that renders a component with country information. On the details page, you can see the country's flag, name, capital, continent, and population. Additionally, there is a button to show the country on Google Maps.
